## Class examples
Below you can see the examples explanation and connection for each class:

### Class 1 - Arduino Fundamentals
This class covers:
1. Introduction.
2. Arduino MEGA 2560 Pinout.
3. Variables in Arduino Programming.
4. Typical Operators for Arduino Programming.
5. Arduino Program Structure.
6. Arduino common used commands.
7. Arduino common statements.

#### Example 1.1 ‚Äì Arduino common used commands
In PIN 13 there is a LED (L1) connected. Blink the LED ¬Ω second ON and ¬Ω second OFF.

#### Example 1.2 ‚Äì If statement with digital input
In the PIN 2 there is a switch (SW) and in the PIN 13 there is a LED (L1). Turn ON the LED if the switch is activated, in other case, turn off the LED.

#### Example 1.3 ‚Äì Traffic light
Write a program that controls a traffic light with 2 maintenance switches. If both switches are activated, the Red light will blink. In other case the traffic light will work normally (Red, Yellow, Green).

### Class 4 - I/O Table and Finite State Machines
This class covers:
1. I/O Table
2. Finite State Machines (FSM)

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidusdavid/arduino-workshop-paris/master/Resources/E42-AdvancedFSM.png)

Do a FSM that controls a basic plastic injector, having in mind the following operation:
* The injector is completely OFF (RT and MT OFF) at the beginning.
* To start the injector, the bSTART button must be pressed.
* First, the injector must check that the raw material is at the required level (SMP1=ùëÇùëÅ).
* Then, the extruder screw needs to be heated using the resistance ùëπùëª until it reaches a temperature of 80¬∞C (ST‚â•80).
* Once the screw is at the required temperature, RT must be turned OFF and MT turned ON in order to transport the melted material until the end of the injector.
* When the melted material reaches the end of the injector (SMP2 = ON), the injector must wait 15 seconds and then turn OFF MT for starting a new injection cycle (from verifying raw material level step).
* If in any moment the bSTOP button is pressed, the machine returns to the initial state.
* Add a counter (C1, Internal Variable) to check if the injection process has compleated more than 3 injection cycles. If this is true, then the machine must return to the initial state.

### Class 5 - Relative Timing and FSM for Arduino
This class covers:
1. Relative timings in Arduino using millis() function.
2. Finite State Machines with Arduino.

#### Example 5.1 ‚Äì Relative timing in Arduino with millis()
Do an Arduino program that allows to blink a LED (L1) ¬Ω sec ON and ¬Ω sec OFF using the millis() function.

#### Example 5.2 ‚Äì FSM with Arduino
Do an Arduino program that blinks a LED (L1) connected on pin 2, ¬Ω sec ON and ¬Ω sec OFF while the emergency button is not activated (BEMG) connected on pin 8. If BEMG is ON, the LED L1 remains OFF and the LED L2 connected on pin 3 turns ON. When there isn‚Äôt anymore an emergency, the process returns to its normal blinking.
